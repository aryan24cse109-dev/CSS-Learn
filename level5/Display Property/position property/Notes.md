<!--- Position Property Notes  

Four types of position property:


1) Static: Default position of an element. It is positioned according to the normal flow of
document. Top, bottom, left, right properties have no effect on a static element.
 Example: <div style="position: static;">Static Element</div>
Real Life Example: A paragraph of text that flows naturally within a webpage, following the normal document flow.


2) Relative: The element is positioned relative to its normal position. Top, bottom, left, right properties will move the element from its normal position.
Example: <div style="position: relative; top: 10px; left: 20px;">Relative Element</div>
Real Life Example: A tooltip that appears when hovering over an element, positioned relative to the element.


3) Absolute: The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (not static). If there is no positioned ancestor, it will be positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the viewport). Top, bottom, left, right properties will move the element from its positioned ancestor.
Example: <div style="position: absolute; top: 10px; left: 20px;">Absolute Element</div>
Real Life Example: A modal dialog that appears on top of the page content, positioned absolutely within a container.


4) Fixed: The element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. Top, bottom, left, right properties will move the element from its fixed position.
Example: <div style="position: fixed; top: 10px; left: 20px;">Fixed Element</div>
Real Life Example: A sticky navigation bar that remains at the top of the page as the user scrolls down.


--------- Z INDEX ------------------------------

 Z-index: The z-index property in CSS controls the stacking order of elements along the z-axis (depth). Elements with a higher z-index value will appear in front of elements with a lower z-index value. It only works on positioned elements (those with position set to relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky).

1) Stacking Order: Elements with a higher z-index value will be displayed in front of elements with a lower z-index value. If two elements have the same z-index value, their stacking order will be determined by their order in the HTML document (the later element will be on top).
2)Positioning Context: The z-index property only affects elements that have a position value other than static. If an element is not positioned, its z-index will not have any effect.
3)Integer Values: The z-index property accepts integer values, including negative values. Higher positive values will bring the element to the front, while lower or negative values will push it further back in the stacking order.
4)Higher Values on Top: Elements with higher z-index values will be displayed in front of elements with lower z-index values. For example, an element with z-index: 10 will appear in front of an element with z-index: 5.

Use Cases: The z-index property is commonly used in scenarios where elements overlap, such as modals, dropdowns, tooltips, and layered content. It allows developers to control the visual hierarchy of elements on a webpage.

Real Life Example: A modal dialog box that appears on top of the main content when triggered, with a higher z-index value than the underlying content.
